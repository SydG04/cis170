# KitBook

KitBook is an e-commerce mockup of a book subscription website. It is a website project I started in my web development class. I'm still working on it, adding new things when I learn more.

## Current Goals/To-Do List
- Cleanup the HTML and CSS rookie mistakes
- Update CSS to SCSS
- Add the API to the All Books page so when a user clicks on a book, they get a **description, rating, and reviews**. I will remove the other API I used on the Feature Authors page when I add this. (This one makes me want to tear my hair out. If only Goodreads never got rid of their API).
