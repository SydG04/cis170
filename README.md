# KitBook

KitBook is an e-commerce mockup of a book subscription website. It is a website project I started in my web development class. I'm still working on it, adding new things when I learn more.

## Current Goals
- Add the API to the All Books page so when a user clicks on a book, they get a **description, rating, and reviews**. I will remove the other API I used on the Feature Authors page when I add this.
- Considering changing the font and still trying to figure it out. If not, then I will make the fonts more consistent.
